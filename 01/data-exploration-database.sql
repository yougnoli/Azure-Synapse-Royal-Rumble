You can browse the content of the files directly via *master* database. 
For some simple data exploration scenarios, you don't need to create a separate database. However, as you continue data exploration, you might want to create some utility objects, such as:
- **External data sources** that represent the named references for storage accounts.
- **Database scoped credentials** that enable you to specify how to authenticate to external data source.
- **Database users** with the permissions to access some data sources or database objects.
- Utility **views**, **procedures**, and **functions** that you can use in the queries.
